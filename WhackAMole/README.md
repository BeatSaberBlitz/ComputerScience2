# Whack A Mole Project
Created a small whack a mole game using javafx involved going between screens and having the user<br/>
be able to interact with the mole on screen.  I also created a slightly different version of the<br/>
project that included a timer, bomb for the user to avoid, and high score tracker to track the top<br/> 
10 scores in the game.
