# Whack A Mole Project
Created a small whack a mole game using javafx<br/>
involed going between screens and having the user<br/>
be able to interact with the mole on screen<br/>
I also created a slightly different version of the<br/>
project that included a timer and bomb for the user<br/>
to avoid, and I added a timer and high score tracker<br/>
to track the top 10 scores in the game.
